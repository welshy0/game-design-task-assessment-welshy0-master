# Game-Design-Task-assessment
The repository for your Game Design Task assessment
  </br>
Important notes:  </br>
• Save, Commit and Push your assignment repository regularly.  </br>
• Make sure you build your game/assignment in a single scene using the included 'Game Scene' in the Scenes folder. The first time you open the project it may default to a new/untitled scene - be sure to open your 'Game Scene' first.  </br>
• Any assets that you create for your assignment should be stored in the 'Your Assets' folder within the Assets folder to differentiate them from the Standard Assets that have been included. You should create a proper file hierarcy within the 'Your Assets' folder (e.g. Animations, Materials, Prefabs, etc.).  </br>
• There is a Game Design Task Report Template word file in the root directory. Use this as the starting point for your report, and continue to save and edit it in this location. This includes a checklist of implemented features. Features not documented in this report will not be marked.  </br>
• Only after you have made your final commit and push and are ready to submit your assignment, you should save the Game Design Task Report as a PDF file and submit it through the provided Game Design Task submission link on iLearn. This confirms to the markers that you are ready for your work to be marked (and any applicable late penalties will be applied at this point).  </br>
• For other assignment details and examples, please refer to the Game Design Task section in the Assessments section of iLearn.
